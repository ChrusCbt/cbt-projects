            <p class="description">I graduated high school from Cape Coral High School in 2021, I decided not to go to college and decided to take the time to learn a skill and that skill turned out to be coding. I am still in the begining of my coding journery but it is going very well so far and I am excited to see where it takes me.</p>

                <p>These past couple of weeks I have taken the time to aquire and master the skill of coding. While I am still very very far from being considered a master I have gotten a lot better in certain areas of coding such as html and css. I would say I have an above average understanding of those two programming languages and plan on adding more languages to my practice.</p>
                
                <h3>Cooking</h3>
                
                <p>Over the past year I found out that I love to cook. I always figured I would like it ever since I learned to make chicken and cut vegetables with my uncles. I've had two jobs so far where I ran a kitchen and even though I don't ever plan on doing that ever again, my love for cooking is still there. (My favorite foods to make are chicken and steak)</p>

              <p class="video-game-1">I love to play video games and it has been a major part of my life since my dad first played Modern Warfare 2 with me and I see video games being a major part of my life</p>

              <p class="reading">I was never a reader and never pictured myself as a reader however, my love of the series Game of Thrones made me buy 5 books and i'm on the second one currently and I would strongly recommend anyone into fantasy to read them.</p>
